Introduction
The goal of this senior design project is to develop an autonomous RC car that can navigate through a Cartesian street grid. The car is equipped with the Picar-x kit by SunFounder, which is a versatile and user-friendly platform for building and programming RC cars. By adding a 9-axis IMU and dual wing IR sensors, we enhance the car's capabilities for accurate motion sensing and obstacle detection.

Features
Autonomous navigation through a Cartesian street grid
Real-time motion sensing using the 9-axis IMU
Obstacle detection and avoidance using dual wing IR sensors
User-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the car
Modular and extensible codebase for future enhancements
